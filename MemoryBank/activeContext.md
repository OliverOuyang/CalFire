# Active Context

## Current Project State
The California Fire Prediction System is an established project with a working codebase. The application combines weather data, machine learning for fire prediction, and AI analysis to provide wildfire risk insights for California regions.

## Key Components
- FastAPI backend with modular services
- Web interface with interactive mapping
- Machine learning prediction models
- Satellite image analysis capabilities
- Integration with OpenAI and OpenWeatherMap APIs

## Current Focus
Setting up a Memory Bank system to maintain context across development sessions and track project progress systematically.

## System Entry Point
- `app.py`: Main FastAPI application file containing core logic and endpoints
- `run_server.bat`: Used to start the local development server on Windows

## Primary Services
- `weather_service.py`: Handles weather data retrieval and processing
- `satellite_service.py`: Manages satellite image analysis
- `analyze_fire.py`: Contains fire analysis logic

## Open Issues and Challenges
- Need for systematic tracking of development tasks
- Maintaining context across development sessions
- Organizing project knowledge in a structured way
- Capturing decisions and progress effectively

## Recently Active Files
- Main application code in `app.py`
- Weather service functions in `weather_service.py`
- Satellite service in `satellite_service.py`

## Next Steps
- Complete Memory Bank setup
- Establish task tracking system
- Create progress monitoring framework
- Define development workflow
