# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are separated by functionality (weather service, satellite service, analysis engine)
- **API-First Design**: Clear API endpoints for all major functionality
- **Layered Approach**: Separation of presentation, business logic, and data access

## Design Patterns
- **Service Pattern**: Separate weather_service.py and satellite_service.py modules handle specific functionalities
- **Factory Pattern**: For generating prediction models based on different input parameters
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface for complex subsystems (e.g., ML model interactions)
- **Observer Pattern**: For updating UI components based on data changes

## Code Organization
- **Component-Based Structure**: 
  - Core services in individual files
  - Feature-specific code grouped in directories
  - Shared utilities in common modules

## Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning when components fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Error tracking in log files for debugging
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Translating technical errors to meaningful user messages

## State Management
- **Server-Side State**: API calls maintain state through session data
- **Client-Side State**: Browser storage for user preferences and recent locations

## Data Flow
- **Input Processing**: User location and weather data collected 
- **Data Enrichment**: Additional data fetched from APIs
- **Model Processing**: Prediction model applied to enriched data
- **Analysis Generation**: AI analyzes prediction results and context
- **Result Presentation**: Formatted data presented through the UI

## Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Weather data cached to reduce API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Map components loaded only when needed
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple data sources processed concurrently

## Security Patterns
- **Environment-Based Secrets**: API keys stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
- **Output Sanitization**: All output data sanitized before displaying to users
